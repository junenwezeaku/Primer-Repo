Remember list,set,dictionary are mutable and tuple is immutable list,tuple elements can be reached by index
for dictionary it is not an option to reach by index the element key has to be known to reach
and for set the items cannot be reached directly but it is possible to iterate.

1. print the lengths of list1,tuple1,set1,dict1
2. print the first element of list1 and tuple1
3. print the value of lion key of dict1
4. change the 2nd position element of list1 to "rabbit"
5. try to change the 2nd position element of the tuple to "rabbit" and explain what    happened.
6. add "monkey" to list1
7. remove "rabbit" from list1
8. in dict1 the number of feet is written as value to each animal the fixh has wrong value     just fix it

list1 = ["lion", "monkey", "dog","fish"]
tuple1 = ("lion", "monkey", "dog","fish")
set1 = {"lion", "monkey", "dog","fish"}
dict1 = {"lion":4, "monkey":2, "dog":4,"fish":2}



	>>
1. len(list1)
   len(tuple1)
   len(set1)
   len(dict1)

2. list1[0]
   tuple1[0]

3. for animal, feet in dict1.items():
    if animal=="lion":
        print(feet)

4. list1[1]="rabbit"

5. tuple1[1]= "rabbit"
   **Generated an error because tuple is immutable**

6. list1.append("monkey")

7. list1.pop(1)

8. for animal, feet in dict1.items():
    if animal=="fish":
        dict1[animal]=0
